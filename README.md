# opensidewalkmap
This repo contains the Map to containing the instances of opensidewalkmap (that shall be created for each city, like in https://github.com/kauevestena/opensidewalkmap_beta ). The one-repo-per-city idea was based on the amazing Equal Gender Names project ( https://equalstreetnames.org/ )


More instructions on how to deploy an instance of OpenSidewalkMap coming soon!
